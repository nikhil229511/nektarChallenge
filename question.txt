You are given a huge log file (which may be gigabytes or terabytes) generated by some application. Please see the attached file for a 5MB extract. There are a lot of lines, but each line is fairly short (up to 256 bytes) and starts with a timestamp followed by some text.


Your task is to design and build a Node.js HTTP server that allows clients to view this log file. There is no need for a UI, your server can just send raw text.


Note:

You should design the API of this endpoint, decide the parameter names etc.

Note that clients are usually interested in logs around a particular time.

You may assume that timestamps are unique, and that the log is in ascending order of timestamp.

The whole log may be too big to read into memory or send in an HTTP response.

You should only use Node built-in modules, no NPM modules.

Hint: fs.read() allows you to read from a particular position in the file.


Your submission will be judged on code quality and avoiding performance pitfalls.
